# Hi there 👋

I'm Ibrahim, a final-year Computer Engineering student at Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT). As a passionate Data Scientist, Machine Learning enthusiast, and Full-Stack Developer, I'm dedicated to building intelligent systems and scalable applications that solve real-world problems.

## Expertise

With a strong foundation in computer engineering, I specialize in data analysis, machine learning models, and full-stack web/mobile development. My projects blend data-driven insights with modern tech stacks, focusing on efficient, user-centric solutions. I've worked on AI-powered platforms, financial inclusion models, and customer behavior analytics using tools like Python, React, and Express.

As a student leader in tech clubs, I've guided teams through hackathons and collaborative projects, emphasizing clean code, performance optimization, and innovative problem-solving. I'm always eager to explore emerging technologies in AI and data science to create impactful, scalable applications.
